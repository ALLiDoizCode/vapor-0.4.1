## Introduction

Vapor is the first true web framework for Swift. It provides a beautifully expressive foundation for your app without tying you to any single server implementation. To learn more about Vapor's modularity, check out the [Vapor Zewo Server](https://github.com/qutheory/vapor-zewo-server) or Vapor's protocol-oriented [Drivers](https://github.com/qutheory/vapor/wiki/Driver).

To start your own project with Vapor, fork the boilerplate code from [Vapor Example](https://github.com/qutheory/vapor-example).

## Work in Progress

This is a work in progress, so *do not* rely on this for anything important. And pull requests are welcome!

## Documentation

Visit the [Vapor Wiki](https://github.com/qutheory/vapor/wiki) for extensive documentation on getting setup, using, and contributing to Vapor.

## Installation

### Swift 2.2

#### Homebrew

```shell
brew tap qutheory/tap
brew install vapor-swift-2
```

#### Manual / Ubuntu

```
git clone https://github.com/qutheory/vapor
cd vapor
git checkout swift-2-2
sudo make install
```

List the available commands of the `vapor` CLI.

```
vapor help
```

### Swift 3.0

Simply add Vapor as a dependency to your project's `Package.swift`.

```
.Package(url: "https://github.com/qutheory/vapor.git", majorVersion: 0)
```

For more detailed installation instructions, visit the [Getting Started](https://github.com/qutheory/vapor/wiki/Setup) section of the Wiki.

## Application

Starting the application takes two lines.

`main.swift`
```swift
import Vapor

let app = Application()
app.start()
```

You can also choose which port the server runs on.

```swift
app.start(port: 8080)
```

If you are having trouble connecting, make sure your ports are open. Check out `apt-get ufw` for simple port management.

## Routing

Routing in Vapor is simple and expressive.

`main.swift`
```swift
app.get("welcome") { request in
	return "Hello"
}
```

Here we will respond to all GET requests to `http://example.com/welcome` with the string `"Hello"`.

### JSON

Responding with JSON is easy.

```swift
app.get("version") { request in
	return Json(["version": "1.0"])
}
```

This responds to all GET requests to `http://example.com/version` with the JSON dictionary `{"version": "1.0"}` and `Content-Type: application/json`.

### Type Safe Routing

Vapor supports [Frank](https://github.com/nestproject/Frank) inspired type-safe routing.

```swift
app.get("users", Int, "posts", String, "comments") { request, userId, postName in 
    return "You requested the comments for user #\(userId)'s post named \(postName))"
}
```

Here we will respond to all GET requests to `http://example.com/users/<userId>/posts/<postName>/comments`

You can also extend your own types to conform to Vapor's `StringInitializable` protocol. Here is an example where the `User` class conforms.

```swift
app.get("users", User) { request, user in
    return "Hello \(user.name)"
}
```

Now requesting a `User` is expressive and concise.

### Views

You can also respond with HTML pages.

```swift
app.get("/") { request in
    return try app.view("index.html")
}
```

Or [Stencil](https://github.com/kylef/Stencil) templates.

`index.stencil`

```mustache
<html>
	<h1>{{ message }}</h1>
</html>
```

```swift
app.get("/") { request in
    return try app.view("index.stencil", context: ["message": "Hello"])
}
```

If you have [VaporStencil](https://github.com/qutheory/vapor-stencil) added, just put the View file in the `Resources` folder at the root of your project and it will be served.

### Response

A manual response can be returned if you want to set something like `cookies`.

```swift
app.get("cookie") { request in
	let response = Response(status: .OK, text: "Cookie was set")
	response.cookies["test"] = "123"
	return response
}
```

### Public

All files put in the `Public` folder at the root of your project will be available at the root of your domain. This is a great place to put your assets (`.css`, `.js`, `.png`, etc).

## Request

Every route call gets passed a `Request` object. This can be used to grab query and path parameters.

### Data

To access JSON, Query, and form-encoded data from the `Request`.

```swift
app.post("hello") { request in
	guard let name = request.data["name"]?.string {
		return "Please include a name"
	}

	return "Hello, \(name)!"
}
```

### Session

Sessions will be kept track of using the `vapor-session` cookie. The default session driver is a `MemorySessionDriver`. You can change the driver by setting `Session.driver` to a different object that conforms to `SessionDriver`.

```swift
if let name = request.session["name"] {
	//name was in session
}

//store name in session
request.session["name"] = "Vapor"
```

## Database

Vapor was designed alongside [Fluent](https://github.com/qutheory/fluent), an Eloquent inspired ORM that empowers simple and expressive database management.

```swift
import Fluent

if let user = User.find(5) {
    print("Found \(user.name)")

    user.name = "New Name"
    user.save()
}
```

Underlying [Fluent](https://github.com/qutheory/fluent) is a powerful Query builder.

```swift
let user = Query<User>().filter("id", notIn: [1, 2, 3]).filter("age", .GreaterThan, 21).first
```

## Controllers

Controllers are great for keeping your code organized. `Route` directives can take whole controllers or controller methods as arguments instead of closures.

`main.swift`
```swift
app.get("heartbeat", closure: HeartbeatController().index)
```

To pass a function name as a closure like above, the closure must have the function signature

```swift
func index(request: Request) -> ResponseConvertible
```

Here is an example of a controller for returning an API heartbeat.

`HearbeatController.swift`
```swift
import Vapor

class HeartbeatController: Controller {

	func index(request: Request) throws -> ResponseConvertible {
		return ["lub": "dub"]
	}

}
```

Here the `HeartbeatControllers`'s index method will be called when `http://example.com/heartbeat/alternate` is visited.

### Resource Controllers

Resource controllers take advantage of CRUD-like `index`, `show`, `store`, `update`, `destroy` methods to make setting up REST APIs easy.

```swift
app.resource("user", controller: UserController())
```

This will create the appropriate `GET`, `POST`, `DELETE`, etc methods for individual and groups of users:

- .Get /user - an index of users
- .Get /user/:id - a single user etc

## Middleware

Create a class conforming to `Middleware` to hook into server requests and responses. Append your classes to the `server.middleware` array in the order you want them to run..

```swift
class MyMiddleware: Middleware {
    func handle(handler: Request -> Response) -> (Request -> Response) {
        return { request in
            print("Incoming request from \(request.address)")

            let response = handler(request)

            print("Responding with status \(response.status)")

            return response
        }
    }
}

app.middleware.append(MyMiddleware)
```

Middleware can also be applied to a specific set of routes by using the `app.middleware(_: handler:)` method.

```swift
app.get("welcome") { ... }

app.middleware([AuthMiddleware]) {
   app.get("user") { ... }
}
```

In this example the AuthMiddleware will be applied to the `user` route but not the `welcome` route.

## Providers

[Providers](https://github.com/qutheory/vapor/wiki/Provider) and [Drivers](https://github.com/qutheory/vapor/wiki/Driver) allow almost any component of Vapor to be extended or replaced.

```swift
app.providers.append(VaporFastServer.Provider)
```

## Compatibility

Vapor has been tested on OS X 10.11, Ubuntu 14.04, and Ubuntu 15.10. 

My website `http://tanner.xyz` as well as `http://qutheory.io` are currently running using Vapor on DigitalOcean.
